# KhanterBot

Prospect of a Discord bot written in **PHP** with a modular architecture.

> ⚠️ The bot seems to be running 24/7 now. However since uses a Free tier on Render, might have some hiccups.  
> It needs manual revival or activity within 50 seconds.  
> (This is currently a **critical To-Do**).
